Although in high school I took programming in correlation to smartphones and focused some time on HTML. Along with that, I am also an alumnus of Girls Who Code, in which we covered basic coding in the most up-to-date languages. Other than that I also studied statistics in high school and dipped my toes into understanding data analytics. ",3,Monday 8pm-10pm
